# Templates style guide

Version number: 1.0
Last updated: August 30, 2022

**⚠️NOTE: This style guide is a work in progress and still contains some of the boilerplate text from the style guide template.**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Templates Style Guide! This style guide is intended for use by contributors of the Templates and Community Docs working groups. It provides general guidance to anyone who contributes to creating templates, accompanying guides, and deep-dive documents for The Good Docs Project (TGDP).

## Intended audience and scope

This style guide is intended for use by any contributor who is creating templates, accompanying guides, and deep-dive documents. This style guide can help contributors produce consistent documentation.

## Our preferred style guide

We have adopted the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for creating templates, accompanying guides, and deep-dive documents. For a quick summary, see the [Google style guide highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights).

The rest of this document describes our project-specific customizations to Google's style guide.

Our project uses standard American spelling and our preferred dictionary is the {[American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).

When creating templates, guides, and deep-dive documents, align with the default guide's voice and tone.

## Glossary of preferred terms

{Calling out how to write your project name first is optional. You can choose to include your project name in the word list instead.}

This {Your Project Name} is represented as {example}. It is {always/never}
capitalized.

The table provides guidelines about the terms you should and should not use for
consistency, listed in alphabetical order:

| Preferred Term           | Avoid These Terms                                                                                            | Explanation                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| for example              | e.g.                                                                                                         | Avoid non-English words                                                             |
| people with disabilities | <ul><li>the disabled</li><li>disabled people</li><li>people with handicaps</li><li>the handicapped</li></ul> | Use inclusive and bias-free language. See [Accessible Writing](#accessible-writing) |
| that is                  | i.e.                                                                                                         | Avoid non-English words                                                             |

## General writing tips

{This section is optional.}

For some general tips about improving writing see:

- [Write the Docs - Style Guides](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/style-guides/#writing-style)
- [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/)

## Accessible writing

Documentation should be written in a way that supports people with disabilities
and users with various input methods and devices. Improving accessibility also
helps make documentation clearer and more useful for everyone.

For resources on making your writing more accessible, see:

- [Writing accessible documentation - Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility)
- [Accessibility guidelines and requirements - Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements)
- [Writing for Accessibility - Mailchimp Content Style Guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-for-accessibility/)

## Inclusive and bias-free writing

When contributing to this project, you should strive to write documentation with
inclusivity and diversity in mind. Inclusive language recognizes diversity and
strives to communicate respectfully to all people. This kind of language is
sensitive to differences and seeks to promote equal opportunities.

For resources on making your writing more inclusive, see:

- [Inclusive documentation - Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
- [The Conscious Style Guide - a collection of resources](https://consciousstyleguide.com/)
